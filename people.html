Major projects include a series of mixed-media paintings, first shown in 2006, entitled <em>Anachronism,</em> as well as <em>Transmigrating Inadequacy,</em> comprised of site-specific murals created from photocopy enlargements of digitally scanned photograms produced from her original drawings. The <em>Transmigrating</em> series was first exhibited in Chicago and later in Berlin, as well as being presented in artist-run centers and public galleries in seven provinces across Canada.After a return to China in 2010, her work has focused on the contradictions and disconnections within Chinese society, and between China and the world.
