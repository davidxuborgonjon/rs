			<p>Learn more about cultural diplomacy in the Global South during the Cold War in a curator tour of this exhibition on Cuban propaganda exports, and peruse Interference Archive's incredible holdings in art and texts from international social movements. Based in Havana and born in the Tricontinental Conference of 1966,  the Organization in Solidarity with the Peoples of Africa, Asia, and Latin America (OSPAAAL) produced nearly 500 posters, magazines, and books from the late 1960s through the present. Marrying unique Cuban aesthetics and revolutionary literature, it focused on fighting US imperialism and supporting leftist liberation movements as propagandists. Regularly produced journals (<em>Tricontinental</em> and the <em>Tricontinental Bulletin</em>), and a series of longer format books featuring the writings of the intellectual leadership of these movements. The public exhibition draws on the Carlos Vega Poster Collection, acquired on trips to Cuba in the 1970s and recently donated to Interference Archive, as well as materials collected by Interference Archive co-founder Dara Greenwald (1971–2012) in 2003.</p></div>

			<p>The short readings of these two sessions will delve into an archive less-read in the Anglophone world: published science fiction writings in officially socialist states from the middle of the 20th century. It is tempting to interpret the scarcity of genres popular in the Anglo- tradition (such as cyberpunk and dystopian fantasy) as merely a product of censorship or cultural regression. Instead, we will identify the utopian and didactic qualities of many (but not all) of these texts as a realist commitment.The encounter with aliens in the Anglo- tradition tends to be “short, brutish and nasty”—as Hobbes observed of humans. By re-establishing contact with this distant planet, this group intends to examine the potential use-value of mid-century socialism’s humanism.</p>

			<p>Besides Imperial and Early Soviet stage sets and cosutme designs for Serge Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes (1909–1990) are strengths, the Dodge Collection also holds constructivist stage sets including ones by Alexandra Exter; surrealist-inspired designs by Pavel Tchelitchew and Eugene Berman also stand out. A large group of propaganda posters and broadsides by leading artists such as Dmitri Moor and Viktor Demi extend from the pre- to post-revolutionary periods. Posters for movies and the theater include the well-known but anonymous poster for Sergei Eisenstein’s film October. There are extensive concentrations of works on paper by such major artists as Valentina Kropivnitskaia, Vladimir Nemukhin, Erik Bulatov, Francisco Infante-Arana, and Raul Meel. Important albums by Ilya Kabakov, Viktor Pivovarov, and the group Medical Hermeneutics are represented in their entirety. Soviet photography is represented by more than 3,500 pieces, from art photography such as work by Aleksander Slyusarev to documentation of artists’ installations, such as the Rooms series by Irina Nakhova, conceptual photography by Boris Mikhailov, and street shots documenting life of Soviet people by Farit Gubaev and Alexander Lapin. The collection also contains major works from the 1920s and 1930s by avant-garde masters Aleksander Rodchenko and Arkadii Shaikhet. Artist-designed books and book covers are well represented within the collection, including a number of important works by such artists as Kazimir Malevich and El Lissitsky.</p>

			<div id='ho' class='expansion'>
			2:00-4:00PM<br>
			Momenta Art<br>
			<p>A performance on Soviet painting in China followed by a lecture on Soviet 1930s museology. These two lectures about art institutions in socialism offer a sober, optimistic alternatives to the shape of art institutions today. Academies and museums all over the world depend more and more on the market. The transformation of the art world into one more just and beautiful would requires a structural change: not just the way we make art, but also how we store, study and spread it. Together, Chang and Zhilyaev show how, respectively, technical training and radical museology could serve as models for a new institutionalism.</p>

			<p>Chang Yuchen's <em>How to Draw in China: K.M. Maksimov and the Chinese Academy</em> is a performative lecture on drawing that employs video, sound and speech. Chang will focus on the life and legacy of Maksimov, the Soviet instructor tasked with bringing Socialist Realism to China. Not only did life drawing have enormous political significance in the 50's, it also served to connect generations of artists.</p>

			<p>Arseny Zhilyaev presents a lecture entitled "Art after the Avant-Garde: Institutional Construction in the Soviet 1920-30s." By examining the transformation of museological institutions during the first decade following the 1917 revolution, just as the museum was abandoned by the avant-garde, Zhilyaev plouts out a path for recuperation of these experiments in contemporary artistic and curatorial practices. </p>
