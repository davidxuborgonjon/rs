		<div id='chang' class='expansion'>
			2:00-3:30PM<br>
			Momenta Art<br>
			<p>
			This conversation will focus on how it was that painting, seemingly the most bourgeois of art forms, came to be understood in communist China as a unique form of artistic expression with revolutionary potential, a prestige that it continues to retain in contemporary practice. An artist and a historian reassess this history and propose new ways for a seemingly solated studio practice be fully engaged with its social context. 
			</p>
			<p> <strong>Jing Yuan Huang</strong>'s work reflects on how Maoist aesthetics have come to be mediated and televised. Her source material is drawn from photographs posted online, humorous or serious. Her painting practice raises the question: what is properly realist if everything is increasingly mediated? </p>
			<p>			
			<strong>Christine I. Ho</strong> researches the practice of collective creation (<em>jiti chuangzuo</em>) in modern and contemporary Chinese art. The story begins from the 1930s Left-Wing arts movement, through the fine and mass arts of the socialist period, and into the contemporary. She has also theorized the reformation of tradition ink-and-brush painting (<em>guohua</em>) into a revolutionary praxis through the valorization of sketching from life. </p></div>

			<p>Learn more about cultural diplomacy in the Global South during the Cold War in a curator tour of this exhibition on Cuban propaganda exports, and peruse Interference Archive's incredible holdings in art and texts from international social movements. Based in Havana and born in the Tricontinental Conference of 1966,  the Organization in Solidarity with the Peoples of Africa, Asia, and Latin America (OSPAAAL) produced nearly 500 posters, magazines, and books from the late 1960s through the present. Marrying unique Cuban aesthetics and revolutionary literature, it focused on fighting US imperialism and supporting leftist liberation movements as propagandists. Regularly produced journals (<em>Tricontinental</em> and the <em>Tricontinental Bulletin</em>), and a series of longer format books featuring the writings of the intellectual leadership of these movements. The public exhibition draws on the Carlos Vega Poster Collection, acquired on trips to Cuba in the 1970s and recently donated to Interference Archive, as well as materials collected by Interference Archive co-founder Dara Greenwald (1971–2012) in 2003.</p></div>
		<div id='fiks' class='expand done'>&#9788; 10|04 &nbsp;'Identity After Ideology': Fiks and Nouril in conversation</div>
		<div id='fiks' class='expansion'>
			2:00-3:30PM<br>
			Momenta Art<br>
			<p>We’ll wonder about the possibilities for post-socialist identity in the former Eastern Bloc. This discussion between artist Yevgeniy Fiks and scholar Ksenia Nouril will reflect on their research into how artists developed personal and communal histories after the post-Cold War “end of history." </p>
			<p>Fiks’ work is research-based, and often focuses on identities that were contested in the socialist rhetoric of the USSR. A current project details the little-known history of Birobidzhan, a Jewish Autonomous State and one-time Zion in far Siberia. Previous work has examined the political emphasis on African-Americans in Soviet conceptions of the USA, socialist Warhols that could have been, and speculations about Stalin as an avant-gardist. He has also examined the suppression of red history local to the United States, as in his tours of New York City’s communist sites or unofficial tours of major collections of art such as the MoMA or National Gallery. </p>
			<p>Nouril’s studies focus on the historical turn in post-socialist art, re-evaluated contemporary Eastern European art not as a re-presentation of empty signs but active agents. Fascinated by Cosmism and the fate of Soviet space dogs Belka and Strelka, Nouril will also be curating an exhibition in the Zimmerli Museum in 2016 examineing the engagement of Soviet nonconformist artists with science, technology, mathematics, communications, and design at the height of the Cold War. Ksenia is a Contemporary and Modern Art Perspectives (C-MAP) Fellow at The Museum of Modern Art, where she researches and plans programming related to Central and Eastern European art. </p></div>
		<div id='reading' class='expand done'>S &nbsp;10|10, 10|17 &nbsp;<em>The Scientific Image</em>: a red sci-fi reading group</div>
			<div id='reading' class='expansion'>
			4:30-6:00PM<br>
			Momenta Art<br>
			<p>The readings of these two sessions will delve into an archive less-read in the Anglophone world: published science fiction writings in officially socialist states from the middle of the 20th century. It is tempting to interpret the scarcity of genres popular in the Anglo- tradition (such as cyberpunk and dystopian fantasy) as merely a product of censorship or cultural regression. Instead, we will identify the utopian and didactic qualities of many (but not all) of these texts as a realist commitment.The encounter with aliens in the Anglo- tradition tends to be “short, brutish and nasty”—as Hobbes observed of humans. By re-establishing contact with this distant planet, this group intends to examine the potential use-value of mid-century socialism’s humanism.</p>
			<p>Reading list:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, “Six Matches” </li>
			<li>Tong Enzheng, “Laser Ray on Coral Island”</li>

			<p><em>Convene for a carpool at Momenta Art at 1:00PM or meet us directly at the Zimmerli at 2:00. Please contact davidxuborgonjon@gmail.com to reserve a spot or offer to drive.</em></p>

			<p>A tour of the largest collection of Russian art in the USA, with a focus on propaganda and nonconformist art led by curator and scholar Ksenia Nouril. <a href="http://www.zimmerlimuseum.rutgers.edu/dodge-wing-upper-level/norton-and-nancy-dodge-collection-nonconformist-art-soviet-union">The Dodge Collection</a> is the preeminent collection of Russian and Soviet nonconformist holdings in the West, and will be the basis of an exhibition in 2016 curated by Nouril on the scientific imagination. Now is the time to get a first-hand acquaintance with a century's breath-taking work.</p> 
			<p>Important albums by Ilya Kabakov, Viktor Pivovarov, and the group Medical Hermeneutics are represented in their entirety. Art photography such as work by Aleksander Slyusarev to documentation of artists’ Installations, such as the Rooms series by Irina Nakhova, conceptual photography by Boris Mikhailov, and street shots documenting life of Soviet people by Farit Gubaev and Alexander Lapin, are all part of the collection. </p>
			<p>As is fitting for the work of generations dedicated to the fusion of art and life, much of the work collected expands beyond the traditional definitions of fine arts. Artist-designed books and book covers are well represented within the collection, including a number of important works by such artists as Kazimir Malevich and El Lissitsky. Besides Imperial and Early Soviet stage sets and cosutme designs for Serge Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes (1909–1990) as strengths, the Dodge Collection also holds constructivist stage sets including ones by Alexandra Exter; surrealist-inspired designs by Pavel Tchelitchew and Eugene Berman also stand out. A large group of propaganda posters and broadsides by leading artists such as Dmitri Moor and Viktor Demi extend from the pre- to post-revolutionary periods. Posters for movies and the theater include the well-known but anonymous poster for Sergei Eisenstein’s film October.</p>

		<div id='raskin' class='expand done'>F &nbsp;10|23 &nbsp;'Concrete Utopia': Raskin and Cufer in conversation</div>
		<div id='raskin' class='expansion'>
			7:00-8:30PM<br>
			Momenta Art<br>
			<p>What makes collective practice so difficult to pursue, so open to co-optation, here and now? And how might revisiting the histories of artistic and architectural collaboration in (post-)socialist states serve as a way out of this trap? Lisi Raskin, who works to make abstraction <em>matter</em>, and Eda Cufer, founder of seminal Slovenian collective NSK, will draw on experiences of Cold War modernisms. The hope is to revisit the idea of utopias as a concrete means rather than an abstract end. This conversation will range over experiments in teaching/learning/building collaboratively, the well-known architecture of the Partisan Monuments and the trajectory of Ljubljana experimentalism from the 1980s onwards. </p>
			<p><strong>Lisi Raskin</strong> explores the intersections between utopian architecture, the idiom of western abstraction, community connectivity, capitalist individualism, materialism, energetics, and art pedagogy. Since 1998, she has traveled to the Arctic Circle, former East German and Yugoslav Atomic bunkers, and through the American west chasing the specter of nuclear-age fears and utopian mythologies as they manifest in oral histories and the architectures of the Cold War. </p>
			<p><strong>Eda Cufer</strong> is a dramaturge, curator and writer. In 1984 she co-founded an art collective NSK based in Ljubljana, Slovenia, and she has collaborated with many contemporary theater, dance and visual art groups including the Sisters Scipion Nasice Theater, the dance company En-Knap, the IRWIN group and Project Atol. She recently published a history of dance notation systems, and is now working on <em>Art as Mousetrap</em>, which identifies radical art practices such as mimicry and over-identification that first appeared in Communist states.</p>

		<div id='rough' class='expand done'>&#9788; 10|25 &nbsp;<em>Tessa</em>: Rough cut and conversation with Anna Rubin</div>
		<div id='rough' class='expansion'>
			5:00-6:00PM<br>
			Momenta Art<br>
			<p>This is, quite simply, a story about a young woman playing the very serious game of imagining a national identity. Tessa is an avid cosplayer who inhabits the young, dashing stand-in for the Third Reich in the popular anime Hetalia (which recreates the Second World War as a playground drama). Anna Rubin will present a rough cut of footage recording her relationship with this Leipzig teenager for whom cosplay serves as a scarce means for an open-ended reflection on German history. A discussion about the complexity of national identity after the end of ideology (and a dearth of ways to think it in post-socialism, after the fall of the Berlin Wall) will follow the screening of the 20 minute rough cut. </p>
			<p><strong>Anna Rubin</strong> works predominantly in video, examining the way different types of cultural performance generate communities on and offline. Anna received her BFA from RISD in 2013 and continued her studies as a guest student with Hito Steyerl at The Üniversitat der Künste in Berlin.</p>

		<div id='rubin' class='expand done'>&#9788; 11|01 &nbsp;<em>The Pink Detachment</em>: Screening and conversation with Jen Liu</div>
			<div id='rubin' class='expansion'>
			7:00-8:30PM<br>
			Momenta Art<br>
			<p>The combination of white and red into pink serves as a social solution on various fronts. Madame Mao’s <em>Red Detachment of Women</em>, a ballet from the Cultural Revolution about an all-women military corps – is redirected towards women whose violence has been transformed from the red of military action to the pink of factory food production. Hot dogs, as a particularly industrial food product, integrates the “undesirable” portions with the “desirable” portions of an animal for utmost efficiency and availability to the masses, while serving as a greater allegory for the possibilities of “pinko” communism: a vision of social harmony through a technologically-enabled abundance, political unification through compromise. This work was developed in part from a Triple Canopy performance and online publication commission, <em>The Red Detachment of Women</em>. The screening will be followed by a discussion with the artist.</p>
			<p><strong>Jen Liu</strong> is a visual artist working in performance, video, and painting on embodiment as a technology. Her work was featured in the 2015 Berlinale, 2014 Shanghai Biennial, and the Whitney Museum and The New Museum in 2015, among others.</p></div>
		<div id='ho' class='expand'>&#9788; 11|08 &nbsp; Drawing Party Lines: Adams, Chang, Zhilyaev on the socialist art institution</div>
			<div id='ho' class='expansion'>
			5:00-7:00PM<br>
			Momenta Art<br>
			<p>A performance on Soviet painting in China followed by a lecture on Soviet 1930s museology. These two lectures about art institutions in socialism offer a sober, optimistic alternatives to the shape of art institutions today. Academies and museums all over the world depend more and more on the market. The transformation of the art world into one more just and beautiful would requires a structural change: not just the way we make art, but also how we store, study and spread it. Together, Chang and Zhilyaev show how, respectively, technical training and radical museology could serve as models for a new institutionalism.</p>

			<p><strong>Chang Yuchen's </strong><em>How to Draw in China: K.M. Maksimov and the Chinese Academy</em> is a performative lecture on drawing that employs video, sound and speech. Chang will focus on the life and legacy of Maksimov, the Soviet instructor tasked with bringing Socialist Realism to China. Not only did life drawing have enormous political significance in the 50's, it also served to connect generations of artists.</p>

			<p><strong>Arseny Zhilyaev</strong> will videoconference in to present a lecture entitled 'Art after the Avant-Garde: Institutional Construction in the Soviet 1920-30s.' By examining the transformation of museological institutions during the first decade following the 1917 revolution, just as the museum was abandoned by the avant-garde, Zhilyaev plouts out a path for recuperation of these experiments in contemporary artistic and curatorial practices. </p>

			<p>These lectures will be prefaced by a discussion by <strong>Jason Adams</strong>, who will place these speculations on the socialist art institution into the context of Jameson's elaboration of a distinction between progress and utopia, as well as Marcuse’s conception of socialist realism.</p>
